The OrconWifiController is used to control an Orcon "Mechanische Ventilatie" unit. Integrating it Home Assistant or your favorite home automation software, it provides the following functions:

- Read the requested speed from the remote or built-in humidity sensor (level 1, 2, 3 or humidity sensor) (pulselength / second)
- Read the current fanspeed (revolutions / minute)
- Control the fanspeed using a PWM signal
- Switch between factory control or Home Assistant control (on/off)

The above functionality is accomplished by installing the OWC in between the fan and factory controller. The OWC is controlled by an ESP (Wemos, NodeMCU or similar) and runs ESPHome or Tasmota. A 220V cable is supplied. All the 220V connectors have the same pinout, so they can be connected in any way possible.

The default state of the relay is that the factory remote is in control. If you want to control the speed of the fan through HA, then the relay must be activated. 

On the PCB, the following pins are connected:
Top-left = 1
Bottom-left = 8
Top right = 9
Bottom-right = 16

Pin 3  = Temp/Hum
Pin 4  = Temp/Hum
Pin 5  = PWM output to fan
Pin 7  = Relay
Pin 11 = Input from factory PCB (PWM)
Pin 12 = Current fanspeed rpm
